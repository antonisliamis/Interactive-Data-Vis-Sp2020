  <br>This visualization shows all of the countries that were host 
  Ted events globally.I used my dataset only for the last 4 years as I had issues with data loading  in D3.The annotations show
  information for every single ciy that these Tedtalks took place during theses for years.

      <br><p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">This visualization shows how HDI (Human Development Index) works proportionally with GDP per capita(Gross Domestic Product).
        The dataset is also for cities all over the world.It turns that the cities that attract Tedtalks have high rates of HDI. HDI comes from with its three
        major variables:long and healthy life,knowledge and decent standart of living. This is also why this HDI rate is moving parallel with GDP Per capita, 
        which also indicates that prosperity index is aligned with rate of Growth.</p></br>
