  <br>My Exploratory session is a small part of Cultural analytics company's new project.This visualization shows all of the countries that were host 
  Ted events globally.I used my dataset only for the last 4 years as they I didn't have thetime to work with the whole dataset.The annotations show
  information for every single ciy that these Tedtalks took place during theses for years.It turns that the events are growing as the years go by.
  In my narrative project which is going to be a continuation of the effort that I have done so far, I will try to improve my main
  visualization and try to show a the big contrast that these Ted Events are happening over the years.<br>From that visualization there are
  various thoughts and patterns to reveal in terms of how these Tedtalks and the general Media theories and events have influnce on these global cities.

      <br><p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">This visualization shows how HDI (Human Development Index) works proportionally with GDP per capita(Gross Domestic Product).
        The dataset is also for cities all over the world.It turns that the cities that attract Tedtalks have high rates of HDI. HDI comes from with its three
        major variables:long and healthy life,knowledge and decent standart of living. This is also why this HDI rate is moving parallel with GDP Per capita, 
        which also indicates that prosperity index is aligned with rate of Growth.In my final narrative project I will try to engaged and analyse more variables than those by using another chart that is also connected with 
        my main global map.</p></br>
        <p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;"> At the same time I will try to explain narratively questions like the following:
     How did globalization and the rise of new communication technologies changed geography of culture? 
     Can we find we every contemporary cultural trend today in thousands of smaller cities? 
     Is it possible that some of these cities are more culturally innovative precisely because of these distances from the capitals and smaller size? 
     Are the growth patterns the same for different fields or does each of them develops in in its own way?</p>
